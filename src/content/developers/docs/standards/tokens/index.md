## Introduction {#introduction}

One of the many Ethereum development standards focus on token interfaces. These standards help ensure smart contracts remain composable, so for instance when a new project issues a token, that it remains compatible with existing decentralized exchanges.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- [Ethereum development standards](/developers/docs/standards/)
- [Smart contracts](/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)

## Token Standards {#token-standards}

Here are some of the most popular token standards on Ethereum:

- [ERC20 - A standard interface for tokens](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)
- [ERC721 - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/)
