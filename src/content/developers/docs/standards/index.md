## Standards Overview {#standards-overview}

The Ethereum community has adopted many standards that help keep projects (such as [Ethereum clients](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) and wallets) interoperable across implementations, and ensure smart contracts and dapps remain composable.

Typically standards are introduced as [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](/en/eips/) (EIPs), which are discussed by community members through a [standard process](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1).

## Types of standards {#types-of-standards}

Certain EIPs relate to application-level standards (e.g. a standard smart-contract format), which are introduced as [Ethereum Requests for Comment (ERC)](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc). Many ERCs are critical standards used widely across the Ethereum ecosystem.
