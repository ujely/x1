You need to deploy your smart contract in order for it to be available to users of an Ethereum network.

To deploy a smart contract, you merely send an Ethereum transaction containing the code of the compiled smart contract without specifying any recipients.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You should understand [Ethereum networks](/developers/docs/networks/), [transactions](/developers/docs/transactions) and the [anatomy of smart contracts](/developers/docs/smart-contracts/anatomy/) before deploying smart contracts.

Deploying a contract also costs ETH, so you should be familiar with [gas and fees](/developers/docs/gas/) on Ethereum.

Finally, you'll need to compile your contract before deploying it, so make sure you've read about [compiling smart contracts](/developers/docs/smart-contracts/compiling/).

## How to deploy a smart contract

This means you'll need to pay a transaction fee so make sure you have some ETH.

### What you'll need {#what-youll-need}

- your contract's bytecode – this is generated through [compilation](/developers/docs/smart-contracts/compiling/).
- Ether for gas – you'll set your gas limit like other transactions so be aware that contract deployment needs a lot more gas than a simple ETH transfer.
- a deployment script or plugin.
- access to an [Ethereum node](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/), either by running your own, connecting to a public node, or via an API key using a service like Infura or Alchemy

<!-- TODO Elaborate on options: e.g. run a node, use a node as a service etc. -->

<!-- TODO! -->
<!-- ### Steps to deploy a smart contract -->

Once deployed, your contract will have an Ethereum address like other [accounts](/developers/docs/accounts/).
