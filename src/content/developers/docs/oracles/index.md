Oracles are a data feed that connect Ethereum to off-chain, real-world information, so you can query data in your smart contracts. For example, prediction market dapps use oracles to settle payments based on events. A prediction market may ask you to bet your ETH on the next president of the United States. They'll use an oracle to confirm the outcome and pay out to the winners.
