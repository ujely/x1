- [Ethereum's original Whitepaper](/en/whitepaper/)

## Smart Contracts {#smart-contracts}

A “smart contract” is simply a piece of code that is running on Ethereum. It’s called a “contract” because code that runs on Ethereum can control valuable things like ETH or other digital assets.

- [What is a Smart Contract?](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/07smart-contracts-solidity.asciidoc#what-is-a-smart-contract) _Nov 12, 2018 - Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Gavin Wood_
- [What are Smart Contracts/Decentralized Applications?](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/what-is-ethereum/#what-are-smart-contracts-and-decentralized-applications) _Updated often - Ethhub_

## Proof of Work and Mining {#proof-of-work-and-mining}

Ethereum currently uses a system called “Proof of Work”. This allows the Ethereum network to agree on the state of all information recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, and prevents certain kinds of economic attacks.

- [What does it mean to mine Ethereum?](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/mining/) _Updated often - Ethhub_
- [How Ethereum Mining Works](https://www.coindesk.com/information/ethereum-mining-works) _Coindesk_

In ETH 2.0, Ethereum will be moving to a different system called “Proof of Stake”. [Read more about ETH 2.0 below](#eth-2-0).

## Clients and Nodes {#clients-and-nodes}

The Ethereum network is made up of many nodes, each of which runs compatible client software.

You can [learn how to run a node of your own](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#running-your-own-node) or find a [comprehensive list of all Ethereum clients](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#clients) within our developer documentation.

## Enterprise Ethereum {#enterprise-ethereum}

Enterprise Ethereum refers to private, consortium, and hybrid implementations of the Ethereum codebase for business applications. Companies across the globe are already using Enterprise Ethereum to streamline financial markets, manage supply chains, and create new business models.

## Improving Ethereum’s Scalability {#improving-ethereums-scalability}

There are many efforts underway to make Ethereum more “scalable” by improving its speed and overall transaction throughput. Generally these are sorted into “Layer 1” and “Layer 2” solutions.

“Layer 1” refers to improving the core Ethereum protocol. The primary project to improve Ethereum’s core protocol is [ETH 2.0](#eth-2-0).

“Layer 2” refers to technologies that are built “on top” of the base Ethereum protocol, enabling greater scalability without compromising on security. There are also “off-chain” technologies like side-chains, which enable greater scalability by making a different set of security tradeoffs.

## Eth2 {#eth-2-0}

Eth2 (also known as “Serenity”) refers to the next major upgrade of the core Ethereum protocol. It combines several improvements to Ethereum’s core protocol, or “Layer 1”.

[Learn everything you need to know about Eth2](/en/eth2/).

## ETH 1.x {#eth-1x}

ETH 1.x is the name for a collection of upgrades to the existing Ethereum protocol. The goal is to continue to improve and maintain Ethereum while ETH 2.0 is developed and implemented.

For more information, see [EthHub’s explainer page about ETH 1.x](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-1.x/)

## Cryptoeconomics {#cryptoeconomics}

“Cryptoeconomics” is the practical science of building distributed systems, where properties of those systems are secured by financial incentives, and where the economic mechanisms are guaranteed by cryptography. It is the general term for the practice of designing and scaling blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
