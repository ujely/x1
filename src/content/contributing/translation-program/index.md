# Translation Program

Interested in translating? Get involved! We're seeking volunteers to join 450+ community members who are working to translate the website into 30+ languages.

## How to join

1. **[Join our project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereumfoundation/invite)**  
   _You will need to create a Crowdin account if you don't already have one. Here's [documentation on how to use Crowdin](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/)_

2. **Find the language you want to translate and select a document. If translation progress is below 100%, please contribute! Don't see your language listed? [Open an issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new/choose)**  
   _A note on content versions: we use version management within Crowdin to avoid translation delays for added content. When you check out a language (for example [Filipino](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereumfoundation/fil#) you'll see folders for each site version ("Contents v1.0", "Contents v1.1", etc.). We encourage you to translate the highest version of the content in order to provide the most up-to-date content to users. If you've already started working on a lower version, that's fine too! We'll add any completed version to the website._
3. **Once you've completed the translation (i.e. all files for a content version display 100%), our professional translation service will review (and potentially edit) the content. Once the review is complete (i.e. review progress is 100%), we will add it to the website.**

Do you have any questions? Or want to collaborate with our team and other translators? Please post in the #translations channel of our [ethereum.org Discord server](https://discord.gg/6WX7E97)

Thank you for your participation in the ethereum.org Translation Program!
