# Adding developer tools {#contributing-to-ethereumorg-}

We want to make sure we list the best developer resources possible so that people can build with confidence and have the support they need.

If there's a helpful developer tool that we've missed, feel free to suggest it somewhere appropriate.

We currently list developer tools on:

- ethereum.org/developers
- ethereum.org/build

**Please only suggest new additions to appropriate pages.**

## How we decide {#ways-to-contribute}

Developer tool submissions will be assessed by the following criteria:

**Is it meaningfully differentiated from tools already listed?**

- New categories or types of tools
- New features compared to existing similar tools
- Targeted at a distinct use-case not covered by existing similar tools

**Is the tool well documented?**

- Does documentation exist?
- Is it sufficient to use the tool?
- Has it been recently updated?

**Is the tool widely used?**

- We will consider metrics such as GitHub stars, download statistics, and whether it is used by known companies or projects

**Is the tool of sufficient quality?**

- Are there recurring bugs?
- Is the tool reliable?
- Is the tool actively maintained?

**Is the tool open source?**

Many projects in the Ethereum space are open source. We are more likely to list open-source projects that allows community developers to inspect the code and contribute to it.
