**Want to get started using Ethereum?** There are hundreds of decentralized applications (dapps) built on Ethereum that you can use today.

## What makes Ethereum dapps different? {#what-makes-ethereum-dapps-different}

Applications built on Ethereum (dapps) can do things regular apps can't:

- Create new kinds of money and digital assets
- Web apps that are unstoppable and uncensorable
- Build decentralized organizations, property, or virtual worlds that are governed collectively

Dapps on Ethereum are web applications backed by [Ethereum smart contracts](/en/learn/#smart-contracts). Instead of using a centralized server or database, these applications rely on the blockchain as a backend for program logic and storage. This leads to potentially unstoppable applications: anyone can deploy a copy of the frontend, and freely connect it to the public Ethereum network.
